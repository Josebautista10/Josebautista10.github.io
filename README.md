# My new and improved Portfolio
For this project I wanted to make a completely new portfolio using TypeScript and a much better design for users. For styling I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with the use of [React Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/) and [React Type Animation](https://react-type-animation.vercel.app/) for some animations. I wanted to try something new so I deployed it using Github Pages. Here are both portfolios for comparison: 
 
* [Old Portfolio](https://joses-portfolio.vercel.app/)

* [New Portfolio](https://josebautista10.github.io/portfolioTS)

## Stack
